Computer science has become one of the fastest-growing engineering streams due to
 the tremendous rise of computer systems and their integration into all aspects of 
 life. Whether it's a basic cell phone or a complex space shuttle, computers are
  present and play an important role in almost every aspect of life.

Data Science is an interdisciplinary area that extracts knowledge and insights from
 a variety of structured and unstructured data using scientific methods, procedures,
  algorithms, and systems. Data science is all about using data to solve problems.
   All components of technology required for obtaining, storing, analysing,
    and comprehending data are brought together in data science..
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal of this course is to generate graduates who have the theoretical
           understanding and skill set to deal with all areas of data creation,
            management, processing, and conversion to knowledge. Students who complete 
            the proposed programme will have a far greater depth and 
            breadth of knowledge in the broad field of data science.

The curriculum is designed in close collaboration with industry which includes
 in-demand tools and technologies. The Department of CSE in Data Science is comprised
  of a group of highly trained and experienced educators who not only convey wisdom and
   knowledge, but also help students develop as data thinkers.
