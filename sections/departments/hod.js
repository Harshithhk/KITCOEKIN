        The dynamic and proactive management of KITâ€™s College of Engineering Kolhapur
         took an early note of the significant role that was to be played by Biotechnology 
         Engineers in future industrial development of biotechnology related processes
          and products by establishing department of Biotechnology Engineering in 2002
           with approval from DTE and AICTE, India. It has a unique place in the development
            of Biotechnology engineering discipline in Maharashtra.

          When we think of an engineering career, we think only of conventional branches.
           The convention that students with PCM opt for engineering and students with PCB
            opt for medicine. But in 21st Century, there is an intervention of biology in 
            every aspect of life. We talk about organic farming , we observe tremendous
            developments in biomedical diagnosis, we see artificial intelligence mimicking
            biology entering into our life. Currently the COVID-19 pandemic showed us the
            importance biotech research where every pharma company is behind 
            the vaccine and drug research on COVID-19.

Biotechnology field in engineering and technological aspect encompasses many areas including
 biopharmaceuticals developments, industrial biotechnology, food biotechnology, environmental
  biotech, biomedical engineering, bioengineering, etc. Considering biotechnology as a fundamental research
  ,it includes different genetic technologies in animal and plant biotechnology, cell and tissue engineering etc
